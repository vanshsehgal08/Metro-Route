# Delhi Metro Shortest Route Finder 

## Project Summary

The objective of this project is to calculate the shortest route between stations within the Delhi Metro network by implementing the BFS algorithm in Python, that efficiently determines the optimal path between two metro stations.

This project showcases understanding of graph theory and algorithmic problem-solving. 
## Future Plans

I am excited to enhance this project further to improve its usability and accessibility. My future plans include:

- Implementing web development techniques to create a user-friendly interface.
- Enabling commuters to interact with the program through a web browser.
- Allowing users to input their starting and destination stations.
- Providing convenient information such as the shortest route, fare, and estimated time of arrival (ETA).

I believe these enhancements will make the project more intuitive and convenient for Delhi Metro commuters.
